## Installation

- You can either install everything manually or use the script i provide. I would do it manually because idk about the script, but you can use it if you want.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Mattio-cmd/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles && chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh
```


## TO DO
- [ ] Make installer script better
- [ ] Improve format
